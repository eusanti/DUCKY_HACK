Duckyhack is a game in which the main objective is to shoot all the programming icons before they hit the ground. 
The programming languages correspond to the different levels and types of difficulty, so, depending on the position where they are and the one you decide to shoot, it will cost more to destroy it and it will give you points.

Being a difficult learning path you will not only have to shoot the icons, you will also have to avoid the enemies, which you can shoot to reach your goal. Train your frustration.

As in any learning process there is always a help, in duckyHack is a worm, when you touch it will give you a doble shoot to reach your goal faster.
